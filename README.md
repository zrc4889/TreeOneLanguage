# TimeLine

## 2021.12 

I joined a group from my first best friend nullptr.

In this group, I met a boy named tree_one_. His really name is also Treeone.

I added his QQ to my friendlist. On this day we 'orz' each other.

## 2022.2

We talk about our scores, the final exam Grade 7. He said he was too low.

Best wishes to each other. We were happy.

## 2022.3

The first exam of the new semester began.

After this exam, I opened my QQ app, sending a message. No one knows that our friendship had begun.

We talk about our teachers, our history score... So many funny things.

## 2022.5

It rains heavily outside with thunder. I opened my QQ again. Talk with tree.

I remember clear what he said: "With the thunder outside, it seems I could sleep easily".

I asked my heart: why did he can sleep easily? Now I found the answer, because he's a tree. A tall tree.

The end of May, I invited nullptr, tree_one_ and some other of my friends to my home to join in my birthday party.

That night, we were all happy. We took a photo happily.

## 2022.6

We cheered up each other, when the final exam came again.

Finally, we both got better scores.
